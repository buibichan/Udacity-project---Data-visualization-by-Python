# Ford GoBike System Data
## by An Bui



## Dataset

The dataset containing information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing
system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area in half late year of 2017 
for approximately 520,000 attemps.


## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, I found that there was a strong relationship between the
start/end time and how people using bike. People use bike mostly on weekday for
going to work and come back in a short distance and duration averagely under 2km 
and 4000 seconds. Although Male and Subscribe user has significant large proportion 
expectedly, Female and Casual(Customer) user ride bike in further distance and 
longer duration. 



## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I start by introducing the time as hour and weekday variables
in distribution, followed by the member birth year distribution, then plot the
transformed log distribution for duration and distance varibles.

Afterwards, I make a heatmap for 2 categorical variables presenting for user
feature, user type and gender. The i use the violin plots for user working age status 
seperate by Monday representing for weekday and Sunday for weekend. Moving on to look
more detailed on how people using bike on weekday and weekend, I creat point plots
for each hour in a day for two categorical variables, gender and user type by duration
and distance. Finally, i observate these two user feature categorical variables and two
numeric variables, duration and distance by user's birth year, using point plots again.
